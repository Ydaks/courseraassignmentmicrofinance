I got recently hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. This reposotory contains their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey.
